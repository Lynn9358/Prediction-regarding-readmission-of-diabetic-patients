# Prediction Regarding Readmission of Diabetic Patients

## Introduction
This project aims to make prediction regarding readmission of diabetic patients using the dataset from Kaggle ranging from 1999 to 2008.  
We also trained several binary classifiers to predict whether a diabetic patient would be readmitted or not.  
The four prediction methods we used to train the dataset are logistic regression, naive bayesian, decision tree and random forest.

## Repository description
* dataprocessing.R: read and clean the raw data, recode for diagnoses and medical, output to    . Code used for descriptive analysis.
* predictionmodels.R: code for spliting data and modeling for logistic regression, naive bayesian, decision tree and random forest.
* resultsandplots.R: code for model comparison using ROC, AUC and confusion matrix and results for the four methods.
