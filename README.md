# Prediction Regarding Readmission of Diabetic Patients

## Introduction
This project aims to make prediction regarding readmission of diabetic patients using the dataset from Kaggle ranging from 1999 to 2008.  
We also trained several binary classifiers to predict whether a diabetic patient would be readmitted or not.  
The four prediction methods we used to train the dataset are logistic regression, naive bayesian, decision tree and random forest.
